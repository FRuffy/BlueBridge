\begin{itemize}

    \item \textbf{prior system}: Camelot is a successor to a
simplistic DSM system. In the prior system "BlueBride" all clients to the
system have an unrestricted view of the entire virtual address space.
Client program were restricted to a single thread, and all paging was
performed using a naive FIFO paging strategy. BlueBride made use of a
novel 128 bit IPv6 remote addressing mechanism which we adopted into
Camelot. Remote addresses are represented as 128-bit IPv6-compatible
pointers. On the client side, all remote addresses are stored as
combination of the virtual pointer provided by the service node and
its source IP address. If a client accesses remote memory, it inserts
the address into the IP header of the request packet. The switch will
route it automatically to the correct server node. \\
