\begin{itemize}
        \item processing data at scale is hard
        \item scientists, not just computer scientists process data
        \item python, and C are more understood / natural than spark/hadoop/naiad
        \item the state of current racks allow for comprable performance with DSM
        \item (small contribution) These system admit failures, but they require expertise to reason about. Applications should be reasonably fault tolerant to prevent heartache, and confusion.
\end{itemize}
