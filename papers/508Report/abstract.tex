Variety of applications require large scale data processing\todo{cite}. Many
different frameworks attempt to abstract away the complexities inherent with
distributed data processing by enforcing programming models. This leads to the
frameworks imposing undo overhead on the applications and performing worse than
a highly optimized single threaded laptop implementation\todo{cite COST}. 

We propose taking the simplicity of a single machine implementation and
combining it with the advantages of a distributed implementation. We envision a
system which turns a datacenter rack or equivalent cluster into a large NUMA
machine. We realize the first part of this system in Camelot, the network
managed distributed shared memory backend. 

Camelot is the next generation of a previous system, BlueBridge, which
implemented the basis for network managed DSM. We expand upon BlueBridge to
bring it closer to our envisioned system by adding support for multi-threading,
improved paging policies, and fault tolerance. We evaluate Camelot on these
three axises to determine if the performance cost of the added improvements.
