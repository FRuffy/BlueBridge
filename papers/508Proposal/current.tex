\section{Current System}
\label{sec:current}
We plan to extend the existing BlueBridge system, a distributed shared
memory cluster written in C. In current BlueBridge, clients are
exposed to a global single address space, which is shared across all
nodes in the system.

Clients operate on their own local in-memory cache, backed by a
customized virtual memory layer. If this local cache is full, the
client process will look up the pages remote address in the page table
and evict the page on a FIFO-basis.  Servers act as simple
memory-banks with the only purpose of storing and retrieving pages.
They do not provide protection nor do they enforce access policies.
Single-threaded C applications, such as \texttt{grep} or \texttt{wc},
are able to run on the remote memory cache, any paging is done
automatically in the BlueBridge virtual memory system.  BlueBridge
does not yet support threading or sharing among processes.

A novel aspect of BlueBridge is the addressing mechanism. Remote
addresses are represented as 128-bit IPv6-compatible pointers. On the
client side, all remote addresses are stored as combination of the
virtual pointer provided by the service node and its source IP
address. If a client accesses remote memory, it inserts the address
into the IP header of the request packet. The switch will route it
automatically to the correct server node. Directory and location
management is implicit by leveraging the available naming scheme of
networks.  BlueBridge is engineered to provide low latency memory
access on the order of a few microseconds. Correspondingly, it
currently uses its own user level networking processing pipeline to
support the IPv6 addressing scheme and latency requirements.

BlueBridge's design of several clients accessing a static single
address space is a suitable foundation to model a ccNUMA system, which may
implement virtual address translation, access policy enforcement,
request balancing, and cache coherence completely in the network.
In this project, we will expand on several features of this system
which will enable BlueBridge to present a disaggregated rack as a ccNUMA
machine.
