    * Version 0.2.5

        * Defer configuration of interfaces until after daemonized; fixes an
          issue where ndppd would fail to set ALLMULTI on the interface
          properly.

        * Fix a cast so ndppd can be compiled on GCC 6.

        * Fix so ndppd changes working directory to / and umask to 0 once
          daemonized.
