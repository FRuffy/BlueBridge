The concept of using DSM in processing graphs has been explored by Shun, who
created Ligra: a graph processing framework for shared memory. ~\cite{Shun:2013:ligra} 
GraphLab ~\cite{Low:2012:DGF:2212351.2212354} is another system for parallel
processing of Graphs, that could also extend to a shared memory model.
Both of the aforementioned systems use a vertex-centric level of consistency, 
but fails to reason about the overall structure of the graph. Placement decisions can be made with a better view of graph structure.
