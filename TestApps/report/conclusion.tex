\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this work we analyzed COST as a metric for analyzing distributed
computation frameworks. We found COST inappropriate due to an inequality
in expressiveness with these frameworks. We demonstrated the
performance advantages of threading highly specific single threaded
programs and propose a framework for doing so. Further we propose a
DSM framework for scaling out threaded graph computation to clusters
of machines without changing a program's interface with the OS. In
addition, we measured the performance costs of graph processing on such
a system, and evaluated the effect of graph partitioning, and RDD vs
superstep coordination on performance.
