Distributed state is a key element of distributed systems that impacts
consistency, performance, reliability, and other system
features. However, in a large implementation distributed state is
difficult to tease out, understand, and check. In this work we
proposed an approach to help developers understand and check the
validity of distributed state in their systems by inferring likely
distributed state invariants. We realized our approach in Dinv, a
static and dynamic program analysis tool for systems written in Go. We
applied Dinv to four large systems and demonstrated that it can be
used to validate useful properties in these systems. Dinv is an open
source tool.
